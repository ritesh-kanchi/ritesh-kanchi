## Hi there! I'm Ritesh Kanchi.
I'm a junior at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu) studying Computer Science with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction. I work on developing and designing experiences that are accessible, impactful, and (hopefully) a bit magical ✨

## About me
My work involves developing and designing experiences that are accessible, impactful, and (hopefully) a bit magical ✨. At this intersection of design and development, I believe in crafting digital encounters that are equitable, inclusive, and empowering, while focusing on the human behind the screen.

In terms of research, I concentrate on accessibility, education, and design within the realm of Human-Computer Interaction. Today, with the increasing reliance on technology and evolving landscapes, these areas are more crucial than ever. I'm excited to address and explore the dynamic challenges they present.

Some questions I think about include:
- How do/can students learn best in a given environment?
- How can we utilize design to drive more equitable outcomes?
- And what happens when we move beyond a touch screen?

Additionally, I create and teach computing and design-related content, aiming to cultivate inclusive learning opportunities within the realm of HCI. Given its interdisciplinary nature, HCI holds the potential to impact and benefit a diverse audience.
