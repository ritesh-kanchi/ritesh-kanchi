## Hi there! I'm Ritesh Kanchi.

I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of Washington-Seattle](https://uw.edu), and I design and build experiences that are fun, accessible, and human-centered.

I'm interested in human-computer interaction, digital social impact, and educational technology.

## A bit about me
I'm passionate about exploring the intersection between design and technology, and using design to solve problems across different groups of people.

I want to design technology that is accessible, human-centered, fun, and simple - with the main goal of creating a more equitable world. There's something empowering about using design to really influence the way people think, feel, and interact with the world through technology.

When I'm not breaking and/or trying to fix things, you can find me watching a movie, attempting to cook, or playing video games (currently playing Splatoon 3)

## Things I've done
- Founded a nonprofit that taught 140k+ students in 110 countries
- Won the Apple WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge
- Moved way too much growing up
- Had my app featured on the App Store as App of the Day
- Designed and built an app hub used by 500k+ people
- Didn't listen to my high school CS teacher
- Got a cease and desist letter from a big music company
- Still trying to figure out what comes next.
