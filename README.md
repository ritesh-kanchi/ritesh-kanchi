# Hi there! I'm Ritesh Kanchi.
I'm a senior at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu) studying Computer Science with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and Design. I work on and research accessibility, education, and interface design/development.

## About me
My work involves developing and designing experiences that are accessible, impactful, and (hopefully) a bit magical ✨. At this intersection of design and development, I believe in crafting digital experiences that are equitable, inclusive, and empowering, while focusing on the, well, human!

In research, I focus on accessibility, education, and interface design/development within the realm of Human-Computer Interaction. I think that these fields are Today, with the increasing reliance on technology and evolving landscapes, these areas are more crucial than ever. I'm excited to address and explore the dynamic challenges they present.

Some questions I think about include:
- How do/can students learn best in a given environment?
- How can we utilize design to drive more equitable outcomes?
- And what happens when we move beyond a touch screen?

I also spend a (probably unhealthy) amount of time thinking about how we can teach computing and design with a focus on equity, opportunity, and depth. Anyone should be able to develop and design their ideas, and I'm constantly exploring ways to make that a reality.
