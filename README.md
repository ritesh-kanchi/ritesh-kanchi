# Hi there! I'm Ritesh Kanchi.
**I'm a senior at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu) studying Computer Science with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction.** My research focuses on designing and developing intelligent user interfaces for niche communities in accessibility and education.

Some questions I think about include:
- How can we preserve designer agency with the rise of Generative AI tooling?
- How can we create learning environments that are equitable, engaging, and empowering for students?
- How can we develop intelligent user interfaces to adapt to a user's unqiue accessibility needs?

Currently, I am: **building accessible data structure representations for inclusive CS education**, **designing systems to support inclusive experiences in mixed-ability families**, and **noodling on new ways to teach design**.
