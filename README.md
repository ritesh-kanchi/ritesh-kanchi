## Hi there! I'm Ritesh Kanchi.

I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu). I work on developing and designing experiences that are accessible, impactful, and hopefully, a bit magical.

## About me
Most people have no idea what "Human-Computer Interaction", or HCI, is. The study of HCI offers us opportunities to:
- Craft delightful and tangible experiences for people
- Make people's lives better
- Empower people to do, be, and create more
I like to think of HCI as the intersection between technology, design, and people. I find myself at this intersection: from researching various topics in HCI to designing and building things that people hopefully *might* use.

Within HCI, I primarily focus on education, accessibility, and the future of computing. How do/can students learn best? How can we utilize design to drive more equitable outcomes? And what happens when we (do) move beyond a touch screen?

At the University of Washington, I contribute to a few groups:
- Makeability Lab
- KidsTeam UW
- Advanced Robotics at the UW (ARUW)
And outside of UW, I contribute to a few more groups:
- Carnegie Mellon University: Cognition, Learning, and Tech Research Group (LearnLab)
- University of Michigan: School of Information

When I'm not breaking and/or attempting to fix things, you can find me watching a movie, trying to cook, or playing video games (currently spacing out in Starfield.

## Things I've done
- Founded a nonprofit that taught 150k+ students in 110 countries
- Won the Apple WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge
- Moved way too much growing up
- Had my app featured on the App Store as App of the Day
- Got a cease and desist letter from a big music company
- **Still trying to figure out what comes next.**
