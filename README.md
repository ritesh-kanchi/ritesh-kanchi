# Hi there! I'm Ritesh Kanchi.
**I'm a senior at the [University of Washington](https://uw.edu) studying Computer Science with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and Design. Across my work and research, I focus on Accessibility, Education, and User Interfaces.**

Some questions I think about include:
- How do we preserve/promote designer agency with the rise of Generative AI?
- How can we create learning environments that are equitable, engaging, and empowering for students?
- Can we develop intelligent user interfaces to adapt to a user's accessibility needs?

Whether it be work or research, I think that a perspective centered around the synthesis of technology and design is important, and something often overlooked. A consideration of real needs, limitations, and possibilities that creating impactful and meaningful experiences: experiences that change peoples' lives.
