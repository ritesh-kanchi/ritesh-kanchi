# Ritesh Kanchi
I'm a PhD student at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu/) in the [Intelligent Interactive Systems Group](https://iis.seas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Krzysztof Gajos](https://kgajos.seas.harvard.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of computer science and design, focusing on intelligent user interfaces for niche communities in accessibility and education. As a human-computer interaction (HCI) researcher, I explore how intentional and inclusive technology design can empower people in their everyday interactions with technology.

A core consideration of my work is rooted in the politics of design and the importance of centering marginalized voices in the design process. Similarly, I believe in the danger of technology that is haphazardly placed in the world without considering broader social and ethical systems. In education, I am passionate about creating creative, critical, and equitable learning experiences in computing and design. Beyond, I am deeply committed to increasing participation and belonging in computing and design through teaching, mentorship, and community building.

Prior to Harvard, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://cs.uw.edu), working on [accessibility research](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/), [introductory computer science education/ressearch](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/ta/alumni.php), and [advanced robotics](https://aruw.org).
