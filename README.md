# Ritesh Kanchi
I'm a PhD student at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu/) in the [Intelligent Interactive Systems Group](https://iis.seas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Krzysztof Gajos](https://kgajos.seas.harvard.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of computer science and design, focusing on intelligent user interfaces for niche communities in accessibility and education. (a mouthful, I know)

As a human-computer interaction (HCI) researcher, I explore how intentional and inclusive technology design to empower people in their everyday interactions with technology. Prior to Harvard, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://cs.uw.edu), working on [accessibility research](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/), [introductory computer science](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/ta/alumni.php), and [advanced robotics](https://aruw.org).

Currently, I am: **building accessible data structure representations for inclusive CS education**, **designing systems to support inclusive experiences in mixed-ability families**, and **noodling on new ways to teach design**.
