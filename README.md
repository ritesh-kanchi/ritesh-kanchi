## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Ritesh! I'm a high-schooler interested in Human-Computer Interaction, Social Impact, and Educational Technology.

I write about my experiences and thoughts on the topics of technology, art, and education. I also create cool things from time to time.

## My work life
I'm also the Executive Direcotr and Director of Technology at [STEMpump](https://stempumporg), a nonprofit dedicated to creating a global learning platform
for contribution, collaboration, and expression. We're 100% student-run, and create free edtech for students. That said, a lot of my work is private, meaning I can't share as much as I'd like. 😓

## Other stuff
In my spare time, I make games, buy domains, design apps, and just make cool stuff. This is pretty bare for now, and I might spruce it up later 🤷‍♂️
